**IMPORTANT**: When working on tasks defined in `TASK.md` files:

1. **Keep task-related files with the task**: All planning documents, implementation notes, and task-specific markdown files should be stored in the same folder as `01-TASK.md`
2. **Separate task files from documentation**: Task planning files (like `XX-PLAN.md`, `XX-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`, etc.) are NOT documentation
3. **Documentation follows locality principle**: Code documentation follows the locality principle and should be stored alongside the code it documents, not in the task folder

# Markdown file naming

**IMPORTANT**: When creating new files in this directory and sub-directories, use XX-[FILE_NAME].md format (e.g. 01-TASK.md) for easy sorting. Increment XX as needed (per directory) to keep files organized.
