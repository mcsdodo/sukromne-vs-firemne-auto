One can decide if would write-off 50% of the car price and "admit" personal usage. Same goes for VAT return - only 50% of the VAT can be reclaimed.

So one can either:
1. declare 100% business usage and keep full VAT reclaim, full write-off. On 50K car price:
    - Yearly write-off: 25% of 50K = 12.5K
    - VAT reclaim: 23% of 50K = 50K/1.23= 40.65K * 23% = 9.35K
2. declare 50% business usage and keep only 50% of VAT reclaim, 50% write-off. On 50K car price:
    - Yearly write-off: 25% of 25K = 6.25K
    - VAT reclaim: 50% of 9.35K = 4.675K

Add an option under the sliders to decide if the user wants to "admit" personal usage (50% write-off and VAT reclaim) or not (100% write-off and VAT reclaim). Adjust the calculations accordingly based on this choice. It should be a toggle switch.

To the company-car table add breakdown of yearly write-off and VAT reclaim based on the selected usage option.
