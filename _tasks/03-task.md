# Cost-savings logic
I am the owner of the company (VAT payer). If a car costs 50K with VAT, company tax is 10% and car is written off 25% per year - the true cost of the ownership 50K - 23% VAT = 40.650 EUR - total writeoff - other car costs.

If I instead bought my personal car and used it for business purposes, I would be paid 0.256 EUR/km + fuel costs. The company would write off all reimbursements as business costs.

I want to see breakdown of the costs and savings from perspective of the company owner - the money is still his, but the way it is spent by the company differs.
