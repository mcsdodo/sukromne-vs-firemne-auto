1. when car is written off (e.g. in case of 25% per year, after 4 years car is fully written off) - there is no more tax benefit from writeoff.
2. when car is bought privately we should not consider whole price of the car when 1 year is selected. Instead consider the part of the car price that corresponds to the selected period (e.g. for 1 year it is 25% of car price if 25% per year writeoff is used)
3. instead of selecting the writeoff in percentages, just select the number of years until full writeoff (e.g. 4 years for 25% per year)
