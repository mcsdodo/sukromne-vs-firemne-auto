# Depreciation
Cars fall in two categories:
1. ICE cars that are written off over 4 years (25% p.a. depreciation)
2. EV cars that are written off over 2 years (50% p.a. depreciation)

Move the depreciation years in the advanced settings under "Tax settings". Make it a drop-down with options 2 and 4 years.

# Selling the car
When selling the car, company has to pay income tax from the sale. Let's assume following residual values at the end of ownership period:
1. sold after 2 years for 80% of purchase price
2. sold after 4 years for 60% of purchase price
3. sold after 6 years for 40% of purchase price

When selling the car after "years input" , calculate the income tax from the sale and show it in the summary of company ownership.
